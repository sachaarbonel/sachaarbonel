Software engineer. Backend and media systems. Seven years in production work. Systems used by 1B+ users. Services handle millions of messages each day. I care about open source, clear design, and steady scale.

## Work
- Media I/O on Pion/WebRTC. Egress/ingress for transcription, recording, HLS, WHIP, and SRT.
- Realtime ASR infra. Metrics in Prometheus/CloudWatch. Grafana dashboards. Faster rollouts with Packer AMIs. CloudFormation upkeep.
- Accuracy. Built a hallucination dataset from a noise corpus. Aho-Corasick matcher in Go with deloops and Unicode range filters. Used across customers, key for healthcare.
- Codegen and SDKs. Internal OpenAPI → server SDK tooling. Own the Python and Go SDKs (~35k LOC each).
- Product support. On-call for outages. Post-mortems. Query speedups with indexes. Quick fixes in chat and dashboard. Spin up Django when needed.

## Results
- Live transcription/CC p95: ~650 ms → ~300 ms.
- Cost: ~36× lower than other vendors.
